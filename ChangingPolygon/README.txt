This project follows the ChnagingTriangle project (If you don't familiar with that, walk to it first). It generalizes the model of a triangle to a random n-polygon. 

I spent a lot of time to figure out a practical algorithm of creating random polygons. I draft the algorithm for it, hope you can read it. 

I also developed a GUI for intuitive thinking. 

Sorry, it's not fully documented. 

It's still developing. I hope someone would help me for the GUI parts.
